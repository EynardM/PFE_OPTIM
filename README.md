# Data Overview

The dataset comprises several CSV files, each providing essential information for managing the oil collection process:

1. **`collectors.csv`**: Contains details about the collectors responsible for moving the tank through the city. Each collector is assigned a unique identifier (`id`) and includes information such as their address, the company they work for, etc.

2. **`makers.csv`**: Holds comprehensive data about clients, encompassing their address, opening hours for oil collection, and details about the tanks on their premises, each identified by a unique ID.

3. **`tanks.csv`**: Contains crucial information regarding the oil tanks, including their unique IDs, capacity, and current fill level. This data is vital for the optimization algorithm.

4. **`measurements.csv`**: Provides data on measurements taken at various moments in different tanks. This information is likely instrumental for monitoring and analysis purposes.

5. **`fillings_stat.csv`**: Offers insights into the filling level habits of each client. This data proves valuable for assessing urgency and determining when to prioritize emptying a tank.

The collective information from these files forms a comprehensive dataset for efficiently managing the oil collection process, optimizing routes, and responding to client needs promptly.
